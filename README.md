### Common
```npm i```

### Development
- Run hot-reload server
```npm run wds```

- Run the app
```npm start```

Change something in any component and the app will be automatically reloaded


### Config

- PORT -> specify the port on which the `hot-reload server` will run and to which the app will listen. Falls back to `4000`
